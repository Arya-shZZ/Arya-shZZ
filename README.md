<h1 align = "centre"> ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Aaryan Sharma!</h1>

ðŸŒŸ About Me

I'm a passionate computer enthusiast from India, currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, England. I have gained some extensive experience across various domains, including hotel Management tools, software testing, and development.

When I'm not diving into code or tools, you'll find me meditating, trekking, or exploring new places. I'm also a fitness freak and love to challenge myself both mentally and physically. Learning new programming languages is something I do for fun, and I'm always eager to expand my skill set.
